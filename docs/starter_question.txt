(Attach the wireframe of the app you are trying to build.)

I would like to build a simple python GUI to label some images.
I will provide the source path where the images are stored.
The GUI will be automatically iterate through the images and display them one by one.
The user will be able to click next or previous to navigate through the images.
When the user moves to the next image, the previous image's label will be saved to a text file.
